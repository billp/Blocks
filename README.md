<p align="center"><b>A Swift library for creating user interfaces using reusable components.
</b>
  
</p>

<p>Blocks is the only library you need to create user interfaces without loosing the flexibility of writing custom code wherever needed. It saves you time of writing boilerplate code again and again by focusing more on the actual UI implementation & Animations and less on figuring out which is the best way to render your views. Inspired by React, it enforces you to create reusable components which leads to writing more abstract code, keeping it clean and modular, which is perfect for large enterprise projects. Blocks utilizes UITableViews and UICollectionViews as containers to render your components, leveraging MVVM design pattern.</p>
